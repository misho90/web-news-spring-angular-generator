boot-angular-pagination-example-app 
-----

This is example application that shows how to add pagination to a Spring Boot Angular 9 application.

It makes use of [spring-boot-maven-angular-starter](https://github.com/shekhargulati/spring-boot-maven-angular-starter) for the initial boilerplate.

I have also written a detailed blog that walks through building the example application in step by step manner.
